# macOS launcher shim for mpv-omniphony.app.
#
# This file is the default CFBundle executable; it sits next to mpv-bin inside
# Contents/MacOS. Its job: resolve the bundled Resources/libbluray paths
# relative to IT (NOT the caller's $PWD / Finder working directory) and export
# the three env vars libbluray probes BEFORE it dlopen()s the bundled JVM:
#
#   BLURAY_JVM_LIB_PATH   absolute path to libjvm.dylib (strongest override,
#                         bypasses dlopen heuristics)
#   LIBBLURAY_CP          absolute path to the VERSIONED j2se jar (e.g.
#                         libbluray-j2se-1.5.1.jar). This value is read FIRST
#                         in libbluray src/libbluray/bdj/bdj.c:556 via getenv.
#                         CRITICAL: the value MUST be the versioned jar name
#                         because libbluray _find_libbluray_jar1() reconstructs
#                         the sibling AWT jar filename by slicing
#                           cut = len(jar0) - len(VERSION) - 9
#                         and inserting "awt-" at the cut; if we pass the plain
#                         libbluray.jar name here, cut <= 0, awt jar lookup
#                         returns NULL, which in turn frees the main jar too,
#                         producing the infamous "libbluray.jar: 0" diagnostic.
#   JAVA_HOME             set to the bundled jre directory when unset so any
#                         fallback probes in libbluray that only know JAVA_HOME
#                         still find the bundled runtime.
#
# Users who want to use their own JDK/JRE can pre-set those env vars; we skip
# overwriting BLURAY_JVM_LIB_PATH / JAVA_HOME when they're already set.
# LIBBLURAY_CP is always pointed at the bundled versioned j2se jar because
# that jar was compiled with the exact meson/jdk from this CI build and the
# native ABI on the C side must match.

# silently disabling BD-J — the fallback will likely still hit the cut<=0
